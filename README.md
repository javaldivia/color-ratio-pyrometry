# Color Ratio Pyrometry

This repository contains code for color ratio pyrometry, a technique for temperature measurement based on the ratio of emitted radiation in different spectral bands. The repository includes tools for processing RAW images captured using a SONY RX10 IV camera and generating calibration data for ratio pyrometry.

### Features:
1. **RAW to TIFF Conversion**: Code to convert RAW images captured with the SONY RX10 IV camera to TIFF format using DCRAW, enabling further image analysis.
2. **Ratio Pyrometry Calibration**: Tools for generating the calibration curve necessary for color ratio pyrometry, enabling precise temperature measurements based on the emitted radiation in different bands.

### Requirements:
- SONY RX10 IV camera
- DCRAW for RAW image conversion
- Python (with dependencies for image processing and calibration)

### Usage:
Instructions on how to convert RAW images to TIFF and generate calibration data for ratio pyrometry will be provided in the documentation.
